With KsMf it is very easy to develop your own proxy server in the style of [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) or similar, with the possibility to customize it to your needs and all the configuration options that you want. 

Note that a proxy is a simple server between you and your intended host on the internet. There are mainly two types of proxy, Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy.

## Get started
In our development package, we have templates that can be taken as a basis for the creation of this type of applications in a simple way.

- git clone https://github.com/ameksike/ksmf-skeleton-proxy.git
- mv ksmf-skeleton-proxy my-proxy-server
- cd my-proxy-server
- npm install
- npm run dev
